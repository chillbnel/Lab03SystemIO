#Word Guess Game
This is a simple "Word Guess" console game. The user must guess what a mystery word is by inputting (1) letter at a time. The game saves all of the guesses (both correct and incorrect) throughout each session of the game, along with the ability to show how many letters out of the word has been guessed correctly.

Each time a new game session starts, the mystery word chosen should come from an external text file that randomly selects one of the words listed. This bank of words is editable by the user; they may view, add, and delete words as they wish.

##Instructions
Upon entering the application you will be instructed to select from one of four options: 1. Play!, 2. Enter a new word, 3. Delete a word, 4. Exit.  Once selected follow the prompts provided.
NOTE: numbers and words are acceptable entries.
